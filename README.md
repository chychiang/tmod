# Tracking Moving Objects of Different Classes (TMOD)

## Project Description

This project aims to solve the problem of tracking moving objects of different classes in a scene. Data will be in the form of a video captured by a stationary camera. We will label object classes and position. This project is particularly interesting and useful to solve because accurate tracking of objects in a scene is critical for many downstream applications, such as self-driving, path planning, and scene understanding.
